# final-twitter-py-bot

This is my simple tweepy bot. It's on version 3.10, so I apologize that I couldn't manage to do this on the latest Tweepy version (4.4.0).

It is essential for you to make a credentials.py file if you want to use this yourself.

I'd recommend of course using it for other purposes, rather than being exactly the same as @BotSocialCredit. You can change the images and maybe even figure out ways to make it funnier!

Thanks a million for your support throughout the months where you all enjoyed this bot.
